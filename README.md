Think about sustainable development. What is in your mind ? Let me guess. A fun that you always want to participate in ! Joking. The majority of you will find it boring and unattractive. However, this "Catch Trash!" application will motivate you on making an impact on our planet. 

## Inspiration

To be franc, at first our idea was not this one. Our goal was to motivate people by money. We made a json questionnaire, where each question was highly researched, and could be answered by a checkbox. Then, we would print how much money they would've saved or gained if they would've been practising sustainable development. However, it was a bit boring to do, and the project didn't seem exceptional to us. 

At 8 pm yesterday, we made like a small reunion, and discussed knew possible projects. Then we had an illumination, Pokémon Go for trash. Pokémon Go on itself's goal is to make people go outside by catching rare Pokémon. We take this idea, and trick it a bit. Our application idea is to make people to do their sorting of trash properly. When they do, the idea was to span a common, rare or exceptional trash. Sadly, we didn't have time to implement the Gotcha properly. 

Another thing important to mention is that we also were inspired by other Pokemon Go concepts. 

- Bags to catch trash acts like Pokeballs.
- We have a map of ecocenters. Eco-centers are our pokestops. 
- Our Trashemons are like Pokémons.

## What it does

Our game makes people sorts their trash. When we enter the application/game, we could see a map of all ecocenters. When we press, the camera, the user has a choice of what trash he wants to sort. Each trash gives a different amount of bags : 
- Trash : 0.2
- Recycle : 0.5
- Compost : 0.5
- Ecocenters : 5.

Ecocenters are given a large amount of bags as the user needs to make a bigger effort. Additionally, today the "e-waste" are a massive problem in our opinion, so we make a bigger emphasis on it. **With at least one bag, the user could catch the Trashemon span.**

Our first idea was about a questionnaire, so we transformed it in a daily for our game. Each time the user does the daily, they get 3 bags. 

## How we built it

We built it with React Native. 
For UI, we used React Native Paper. 
Thank you, Bell, for the workshop on React that you have made for us!

## Challenges we ran into

- Choosing the right idea too late, hahahaha.
- Using React for the first time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Taking Pictures.
- Making a map with all ecocenters.
- Making the catch the trash main, as easy as it sounds.
- Loading the picture that we took on the game.
- Choosing an idea as the theme is so difficult, and needs some research to make something original.

## What we learned

- React Expo
- Making an mobile application
- A lot of ways that we as individuals have an impact. Even emails saved on our accounts, make CO2 emissions !

## What's next for Catch Trash!

- Add more Trashemons
- Finish the dailies : thought the json and questionnaires are ready, so would not take that long.
- Make function that application as it doesn't work as well as we wish for.
- Track the user path on the map.
- Finish the bags counter as it is not implemented completely. 
- Detection of whether the person used the right bin with AI.
